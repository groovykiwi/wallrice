## Features

- **Built-in Color Palettes**: Choose from themes like Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Dracula, and more.
- **Custom Color Selection**: Select specific colors from palettes or add your own.

## How It Works

WallRice uses a locally-executed image processing engine powered by the browser's Canvas API. The `imageColorizer.ts` utility handles all the heavy lifting, converting image colors using perceptually uniform Lab color space calculations. This ensures high-quality, accurate colorization without any cloud processing.
